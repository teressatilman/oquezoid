Listen to official albums Hi all! This is a project I have been working on for quite some time. I know playing YGO cube format isn't a new idea, but when I, a primarily MTG player who takes an interest in YGO on the side, discovered the standard was to change the rules and treat all monsters as all types, I was horrified!

I'm left speechless. Murder, execution, incest, all in the pilot episode. Figured it was going to be a slow grind and build up to get to the good parts, but nope it just throws you right into it.

Wish me luck, hopefully I'll be able to watch Season Iron Maiden/Prowler (Soundhouse Tapes) Twilight Zone/Wrathchild/Killers (Dickinson Audition)  labeled as Zero-Oh Baby. There was also SoT guitar solo - labeled as "Walking on glass" up there. Is this even Bruce? P.S. I think that files I had in that directory equal.
